Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. As we know, for executing any process memory is required. And when it comes to accessing things from a hard disk, the process becomes very slow as a hard disk is the slowest part of our computer. There are various methods by which the process can be scheduled and can be done efficiently.',
